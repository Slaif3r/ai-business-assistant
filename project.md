# AI Business Assistant

## 1. Project Overview

**AI Business Assistant** is a public, production-oriented AI product designed to help non-technical users extract value from business data.

This is **not a demo project**.  
It is built as:
- A learning-by-building journey
- A portfolio-grade AI system
- A foundation for a future monetizable service

The project focuses on **product thinking**, not just models.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many small businesses:
- Have access to data (CSV, spreadsheets)
- Lack data science or AI expertise
- Cannot easily extract insights, trends, or predictions

Existing tools are often:
- Too technical
- Too expensive
- Too generic
- Not explainable

---

## 3. Solution

AI Business Assistant provides:

- Simple data ingestion (CSV)
- Automatic data cleaning & validation
- Exploratory data analysis
- AI-driven insights and predictions
- Human-readable explanations
- A user-friendly interface (planned)

The goal is to turn **raw data → business decisions**.

---

## 4. Target Users

- Small business owners
- Managers
- Entrepreneurs
- Non-technical decision-makers

No prior AI or programming knowledge is assumed.

---

## 5. Product Philosophy

This project follows these principles:

- **AI is part of the product, not the product**
- Every feature must solve a business problem
- Explainability > raw accuracy
- Simplicity beats complexity
- Documentation is as important as code

---

## 6. Learning & Development Approach

Time investment:
- ~90 minutes per day

Each day is split into:
- **Theory** → Concepts needed for the product
- **Practice** → Code or documentation added to the repo

Every step produces tangible artifacts:
- Markdown docs
- Python scripts
- Architecture decisions
